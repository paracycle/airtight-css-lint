# Airtight CSS

Check CSS (manual or generated from LESS/SASS) for better encapsulation and reduced side-effects/interactions between displayed elements. Expands on [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/).

As a result:

* style is constrained into a composable component structure for faster development
* style modifications/refactors have less chance of introducing visual regressions
